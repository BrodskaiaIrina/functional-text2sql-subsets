## 📖 Overview

**RedSQL** is the first domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmark in Russian, designed to evaluate large language models' performance on specialized database queries across nine high-impact domains. This benchmark addresses the gap between academic text-to-SQL datasets and real-world applications by incorporating domain-specific terminology, complex schema structures, and realistic operational scenarios.

### Key Features

- 🌍 **9 Domain-Specific Datasets**: Banking, Aviation, Medicine, Logistics, Jurisprudence, Architecture, Energy, Science & Research, and Engineering
- 🇷🇺 **Russian Language Focus**: First comprehensive Russian text-to-SQL benchmark for domain-specific applications
- 📊 **409 Curated Query Pairs**: Carefully crafted natural language questions with corresponding SQL queries
- 🏗️ **Complex Schema Structures**: Average of 15.4 tables per database and 4.6 tables per query
- 🔬 **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Analysis of 5 state-of-the-art LLMs with both English and Russian prompts

## 🎯 Motivation

Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks like Spider and WikiSQL focus on general-domain scenarios and primarily English language. However, real-world applications often involve:

- **Domain-specific terminology** (e.g., ICD codes in healthcare, technical abbreviations in aviation)
- **Complex legacy schemas** with opaque column names and sparse documentation
- **Specialized query patterns** typical of operational environments
- **Non-English language requirements** for global deployment

RedSQL bridges this gap by providing a realistic testbed for evaluating model robustness under domain shift, particularly in Russian-language contexts.
